            HomeKU Libraries Exhibits Program  
The Libraries Exhibits Program highlights the strengths of the libraries’ collections and the creative scholarship of our KU campus community. In partnership with other cultural venues at KU and throughout our local and regional community, the exhibitions promote the scholarly and educational mission of the University, reflect the Libraries' commitment to freedom of information and cultural diversity, and stimulate academic discourse on campus.
