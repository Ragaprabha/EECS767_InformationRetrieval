	FAQ
		How do I use my KU Cuisine Dining Plan? Your KU Card is required for each transaction. All you need to do is present your KU Card for access/meal swipe in the Residential Dining Centers or have your card scanned at any of the Campus Retail Cafes to use your KU Cuisine Cash or Beak ´Em Bucks.
Where can I use my Dining Plan options?We offer maximum flexibility at our 22 campus locations − including residence hall (all you-care to eat) dining centers, Cuisine to Go (sack meals), retail cafés in the KU Memorial Unions and Pharmacy building located on West Campus, as well as convenient Jay Breaks (snack bars). Here is how the different components of the dining plans are used:
	¨Dining Center Access/Meals¨Includes access to Ekdahl Dining Center (Mrs. E´s), Oliver Dining Center, and North College Cafe Dining Center for meals or snacks. Also can be used for Cuisine To Go at The Studio Café (Hashinger Hall), O´zone (Oliver Hall) or North College Cafe Dining Center.
	¨Bring A Friend¨ Meals:Assigned to the KU Card and can be used at the all-you-care-to-eat Dining Centers to host friends or family. Bring A Friend meals do not deduct from the total Dining Center Meals. Inform the cashier that you wish to use a Bring A Friend meal before your KU Card is run through at the register.
	¨KU Cuisine Cash¨: Use at all 22 locations on campus and for Domino´s and Glory Days Pizza delivery. To view the campus locations click here.
What does ¨Unlimited Access¨ mean on the Jayhawk Unlimited $500 Plus and Rock Chalk Unlimited $300 Plans? Unlimited access means you may enter the dining center (Mrs. E´s, North College Cafe or Oliver Dining) as many times as you like during normal hours of operation. There is no cap on the number of times you may enter each day, provided you have one of the following active KU Cuisine Dining Plans: Jayhawk Unlimited $500 Plus Plan or Rock Chalk Unlimited $300 Plan. It is ideal for students who eat several smaller meals per day or for students who utilize the dining centers for studying and have access to snacks.
 How do the weekly plans (Blue Basic and Campanile Apartment) work?
The Blue Basic, and Campanile Apartment plans all have meals that reset every Monday morning.Meals do not roll over.
 How does the 'free Za pizza bonus' work for the Jayhawk Unlimited $500 Plus and Rock Chalk Unlimited $300 Plans?Free Za Pizza is available at The Studio, 2nd floor of Hashinger Hall, and Ozone, 1st floor of Oliver Hall. Free Za Pizzas are activated the Tuesday following the deadline for meal plan changes. Fall semester is September 8, 2015 and spring semester is February 2, 2016. One free large one-topping pizza allowed per day.
 What is the difference between KU Cuisine Cash and Beak ´Em Bucks? KU Cuisine Cash is part of the dining plan and cannot be recharged. Beak ¨Em Bucks is a declining balance account that is automatically set up for you when the KU Card is issued and can be recharged. If there are both accounts on a KU Card, the system is programmed to use KU Cuisine Cash first and then Beak ´Em Bucks.
 What is ¨Cuisine to Go¨?  A quick ¨to go¨ meal exchange on your KU Cuisine dining plan (dining center access/meals) that allows you the flexibility and convenience to select from varied menu options of foods and beverages to take with you on those busy days when you cannot get back to your favorite dining center. You can select ¨Cuisine to Go¨ service up to two meals per day during the service hours posted in each location (Studio Café, Oliver Dining and North College Café). ¨Cuisine To Go¨ service hours are available on this page of our website under the Residential Dining hours.
 What factors should I consider when choosing a Dining Plan? 
	Do you typically eat three meals daily (with snacks)?
	Will you be away from campus most weekends?
	Will you have a job that provides meals?
	Will you be involved in extracurricular activities (sorority/fraternity, sports, or band)?
	Do you plan to study on campus or in the residential dining centers?
Your responses determine the quantity of meals you would require through the year/semester. If you typically eat three meals a day and plan to study on campus, then the Jayhawk Unlimited $500 Plus Plan is your best value. If you plan to join a sorority/fraternity that also provides meals, you may want to select a plan that offers fewer meals.
How are dining plan prices figured? 
There is a great deal that goes into providing student meals in three all-you-care-to eat dining centers on campus.We ask that you take into consideration the ¨big picture¨ of the overall meal plan cost.
To ensure that we are providing our guests with the most value, we:
	Research the latest consumer price index for food for the coming year
	Calculate our fiscal expenses
	Determine the total number of operating days for the academic year in order to establish the prices for each meal plan option offered
Where does the money I spend with KU Dining go?
KU Dining is a not-for-profit 5013c organization and receives no funding from the State of Kansas. All revenues go directly back into dining programs and facilities. Here is the breakdown for those allotments:
	Food (all food and paper supplies):39%
	Human Resources (salaries, wages and benefits, including employee meals):37%
	General Expenses (utilities, uniforms, laundry, cleaning chemicals, telephone, office supplies, etc.):18%
	Reserves (facility and equipment repairs/renewals): 6%
What if I´m not living on campus? 
That&#8217;s okay. KU Cuisine Dining Plans are available to any KU student. All you need is an active KU Card.
