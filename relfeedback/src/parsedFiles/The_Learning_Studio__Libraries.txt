The Learning Studio
Ideate Lawrence 2015: Water&nbsp;    
                                The Learning Studio
        The Learning Studio is a partnership of KU Libraries, Undergraduate Studies and KU Information Technology to create a dynamic, student-centered space located on the 3rd and 4th floor of Anschutz Library. It builds on the success Anschutz Library already enjoys as the central hub of undergraduate research and learning at KU. The Studio features technology, an integrated service point, and a variety of study spaces. All of this is brought together with librarians, IT professionals and academic achievement staff, to support students in writing, research, study skills and use of technology.
This welcoming environment offers unique opportunities for students to collaborate with their peers, study and research, and find support for their academic work.
