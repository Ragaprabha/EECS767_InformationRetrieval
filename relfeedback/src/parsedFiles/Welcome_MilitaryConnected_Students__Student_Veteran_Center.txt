        Welcome Military-Connected Students
The KU Student Veteran Center is the University’s single point of contact to coordinate integrated support to military-connected students. We connect students with veteran-centered academic support, career services, health care and wellness resources, and more.
Benefits
The Office of the Registrar helps all students using federal and state veterans’ education benefits, and walks current and prospective students through the benefits application and certification process. 
Academic Support
KU offers a wide array of Academic Resources ranging from workshops, tutoring, supplemental instruction, and even individual consultation.
Health Care and Wellness

As a student-focused, student-friendly center, its mission is to advance the quality of life for university students, improving academic performance and increasing retention.
Campus and Community Outreach
In the military, we all recognized that we were only as strong as the community and support we have around us. We connect students to campus opportunities, including the KU Student Veterans of America. Be a part of our thriving veteran community.
