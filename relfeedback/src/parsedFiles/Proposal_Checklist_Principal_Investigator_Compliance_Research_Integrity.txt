                                PI Proposal Checklist
        The first step in the proposal process, the PI Proposal Checklist is a tool for submitting grant proposal compliance information and assurances to the KU Center for Research. The lead principal investigator (PI) of a proposed project must complete and submit the online form in order for KUCR to review and submit the final proposal. The lead PI is the only person who must complete the checklist.
