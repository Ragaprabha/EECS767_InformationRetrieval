The KU Memorial Unions are the gathering place on campus. Many students refer to the Unions, and the Kansas Union in particular, as their home away from home. It’s the first place students often visit on campus, and its where many of their college memories will be made.
Whether students or guests want to eat, meet, shop, study, relax, bank, watch a movie, attend events, or rally at a watch party, they’ll do it at the Unions.
Stay on top of all Union events, activities and special deals and offers through social media or by receiving our newsletter &#8211; you can sign up on our news page for &#8216;News From the U.&#8217;
See you at the U!
