Since 1873, Greek life has grown to become a vital part of the history and tradition of KU.  Today, KU Greek life represents more than 3,600 students (18% of the undergraduate student population) and 45+ fraternities and sororities.  Each fraternity and sorority is a member of one of the four governing councils; the Interfraternity Council (IFC), the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), and the Panhellenic Association (PHA). Fraternities and sororities enhance the quality of student life at the University of Kansas. Their commitment to the Four Pillars of Greek Life promotes and provides academic support for their members, leadership development, life-long friendships and opportunities participate in service to the community.
