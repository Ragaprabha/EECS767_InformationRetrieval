      First-Time Freshman
Also referred to as a new freshman, this is a student who starts at KU immediately after graduating from high school or has never attended another college or postsecondary institution. Students who graduate from high school in spring and enroll at KU for fall of the same calendar year are first-time freshmen, regardless of the number of college or advanced placement credits earned.
Standard Tuition Rates
These are the per-credit-hour rates that all KU resident and nonresident students will pay. Since standard tuition rates are set annually by the Kansas Board of Regents, future standard tuition rates are unknown.
Compact Tuition Rates
Compact Tuition is available as an option to first-time, degree seeking freshmen (both resident and non-resident). This tuition has the same rate for four years starting freshman year and is designed to provide financial predictability, account for future inflation and increases in tuition. Therefore it is higher at the onset because it is an average of what the university anticipates four years at KU will cost.
Required Campus Fees
These are campus fees, approved by and paid by all students, to support services and programs on campus, such as health, recreation, transportation and student activities.
Course Fees
Course Fees are an additional per-credit-hour charge that varies by school within the university to support academic programs and instruction in that specific school.
