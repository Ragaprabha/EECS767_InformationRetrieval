                                        Email upgrade at KU brings changes and improvements
            Beginning on Tuesday, Aug. 11, KU Information Technology is upgrading the University’s email platform. This upgrade will not significantly change the Windows Outlook desktop client, but you will see improved design and new features in the Outlook Web App.
Outlook Web App (OWA)
	If you read your email online using OWA, you’ll see significant improvements to the look and functionality. Here are just some of the new features:
	User experience and interface is optimized depending on whether you’re on a desktop, tablet or smartphone.
	A cleaner, simplified design provides a more consistent experience across all devices.
	Forgotten Attachment Detector warns you that you might not have added an intended attachment.
	You can select different design themes to personalize your emails.
	The new OWA supports apps that extend information and the functionality of messages and calendar items. For example, you’ll see a Bing map link in emails that include an address.
Click here to read more about the new features and benefits in Outlook Web App.
We’re confident that the new design and features in OWA will provide a better experience and improved functionality, whether you access your KU email online from a computer, tablet or smartphone.
Outlook Desktop
If you use Outlook on your Windows desktop computer or laptop to read email and manage your calendar, after the email upgrade you will receive the following pop-up message in Outlook:
The upgrades will begin on Aug. 11 and take about 10 days. You will see the above message after your email mailbox is upgraded sometime during this time period. Faculty and staff who have more than one email account connected to Outlook (e.g., shared department email address) may receive the pop-up message more than once. This upgrade will not affect your email or your calendar, and you won’t notice significant changes to the design of the Windows Outlook desktop client. As in OWA, however, you will see extended information and functionality, such as a Bing map link in emails that include an address.
Improvements to Email
Benefits of this email upgrade include a more consistent system infrastructure, better security and a reduction in potential downtime. Later in the fall semester we will announce additional changes to email, which will provide additional security improvements along with new features and benefits.
We make system upgrades like this during the summer and academic breaks to minimize the disruption of services for our students, faculty and staff. If you have questions or comments about the email upgrade, please reply to this email or contact us at 785-864-8080. We appreciate your feedback on this or any other IT-related issue.
