 Feedback or Enhancement Ideas
      Blackboard Workshops include:
Blackboard: Getting Started
This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to the Blackboard Learn interface and organization features. You will focus on navigation, the course style, and the process of planning, adding, and organizing links on the course menu. 
Along the way, you will examine different strategies for organizing the course menu, which is the students’ access point to tools and content. Finally, you will consider ways you can influence your students’ impressions of the online learning environment.
Register for Blackboard: Getting Started
Blackboard: Assignments
The assignments tool enables you to create, manage, and distribute activities that assess students in meaningful ways beyond traditional objective tests.
The Grade Center's organization and management capabilities are incorporated into the assignments tool, allowing you to provide feedback and grades efficiently.
Register for Blackboard: Assignments
Blackboard: Discussions
Online discussions provide some unique benefits. Because students can take time to ponder before posting ideas, you may see more thoughtful conversations play out.
You can observe as students demonstrate their grasp of the material and correct misconceptions. You can extend your office hours by reaching students more often during the week so learning is continuous.

Blackboard: Groups
In this workshop, you learn to facilitate collaboration among students by setting up groups. In Blackboard Learn, groups can have their own discussion board, blog, journals, wikis, and live chats. Group members can exchange documents, submit group assignments, send email to other group members, and distribute tasks to keep the group on track.
Register for Blackboard: Groups
Blackboard: Tests
In Blackboard Learn, you can use tests to measure student knowledge, gauge progress, and gather information from students.
In this workshop, the main focus is on creating tests and questions, choosing appropriate settings, and adding tests to course areas. Along the way, you will learn some best practices for using tests as teaching tools and encouraging academic honesty.
Register for Blackboard: Tests
Blackboard: Blackboard Collaborate
Blackboard Collaborate is a web conferencing platform which instructors can use to schedule synchronous class sessions. Collaborate can be launched directly from your Blackboard course.
Synchronous class sessions are a convenient medium for collaborative, interactive, and mobile learning.
