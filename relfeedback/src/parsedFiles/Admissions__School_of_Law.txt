A law school where value matters.
At KU Law, we don’t define value in traditional terms. Instead, we ask ourselves what we can provide to our students that will enable them to excel in whatever career they choose. The answer aligns with the unique strengths of KU Law:
The people: building a student-focused community with a commitment to mentoring and leading tomorrow's leaders in the field of law.
	The program: integrating one of the nation’s leading clinical law programs with traditional classroom curriculum so our graduates will be prepared to practice law in a number of fields or use their legal education to excel in business, government or public interest. 
	The possibilities: awarding a degree that is recognized in Kansas and throughout the nation, and becoming part of a 7,600-strong network of dedicated and talented alumni who are always willing to help a fellow Jayhawk. 
	The place: living in Lawrence, Kansas, one of the nation’s favorite college towns filled with vibrant, engaging people and institutions that promote community and growth.
The University of Kansas was established by activists who envisioned a free state in which every citizen would have legal rights and the protection of the law. We continue to educate students armed with the knowledge and skills to be strong advocates for their clients and bold leaders in their communities.
Make a wise choice: Join KU.
