                                KU Parent E-Newsletter
        The KU Parent E-Newsletter is an announcement-only list designed to send updates on selected campus events, reminders for deadlines and dates, and information about University activities.
Why join the KU Parent E-Newsletter?
The KU Parents E-Newsletter is available for parents or guardians of KU students as an information resource in the form of an e-newsletter. This list will bring information about KU straight to your e-mail box on a regular basis. Additionally, announcements concerning KU programs, services, events or activities may come to you from the greater University community.
How do I join?
Just fill out the form. All we need is your e-mail address and screen name.
How do I quit?
The list is easy to quit if you find that it is not for you. Unsubscribe to remove yourself from the KU Parent E-Newsletter.
How does it work?
Once you join, you will be sent an e-mail explaining all of the details. An announcement-only list will only allow administrators at the University of Kansas to send messages. Although some lists allow for the participants to send messages to the list which will then be sent to everyone, this is not the case with the KU Parent E-List.
