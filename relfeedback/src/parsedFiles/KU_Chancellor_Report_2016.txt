            KU diabetes researchers invent new lab technique &mdash; then spin off a biotech firm
        Health care technology is a complex field, but KU Medical Center’s Lisa Stehno-Bittel has learned not to overlook what is small or simple.
        Stehno-Bittel, professor of physical therapy and rehabilitation science and one of the world’s leading diabetes researchers, focuses on islets, cells that produce insulin in the pancreas. While working on islet transplant experiments, her lab manager, Janette Williams, pointed out something — something simple they hadn’t noticed before.
        Smaller islets behaved differently than larger islets. The small islets were more robust and produced more insulin than larger islets. And when they transplanted only small islets into diabetic rats, the rats were cured. If they transplanted only large islets, the rats were never cured.
        But this breakthrough presented another problem — how to reengineer the large islets to make them function like small ones. They couldn’t just throw away healthy tissue. They investigated complex solutions for five years, until Karthik Ramachandran, then a KU bioengineering doctoral student, invented a simple answer.
                    Lisa Stehno-Bittel is professor and department chair of physical therapy and rehabilitation science in the School of Health Professions. She co-founded Likarda LLC with former bioengineering doctoral student Karthik Ramachandra
