Calorie CountingCounting calories is no easy task! Many modern day calorie counting tools are available. Do you need assistance? Read on&#8230;
Healthy Eating
The Academy of Nutrition &amp; Dietetics stresses a normal diet should include 25-30% fat calories, 15-20% protein calories, and 55-60% carbohydrate calories. For the average person these amounts will keep the body functions working well. Learning what your body calorie consumption plan should be can help you with keeping calorie percentages for fat, protein, and carbohydrate in line with these guidelines.
Label Reading
The basis for nutrition fact calculations revolve around a 2,000 calorie consumption plan&#8230;
Read the nutrition fact chart (on packaging) to find:
	the serving size and gram weight
	total calories for the serving size
	fat grams and % daily value
	carbohydrates and % daily value
	protein grams and % daily value
	sugar grams
	ingredients
Read the nutrition facts next to the menu items @ the point of service in your residential dining unit to find:
	Total calories
	Fat grams (1 gram = 9 calories)
	Protein grams (1 gram = 4 calories)
	Carbohydrates grams (1 gram = 4 calories)
You can then decide whether the food has too many total calories or fat grams or carbohydrate grams to fit into your calorie control plan. Keep track of your serving to then utilize KU Dining´s NetNutrition® resource.

Healthy Dieting Weight gain research over the years have shown that 18-19 yr old adults gain 15 pounds as a college freshmen. Recent research shows decreased gains of only 5-10 pounds. Want to prevent weight gain? Follow these tips.
The Academy of Nutrition &amp; Dietetics advocates consuming nutrient dense foods packed with calcium/vitamin D, iron, zinc, vitamin A/C, potassium, high quality protein, and many other nutrients.
New marketing packaging components show a check mark in various forms including the American Heart Association´s check in a heart. To consume healthier foods in a normal or weigh control diet eat adequate portions of dairy foods, red meat/fish/poultry each twice per week, whole fruits/vegetables/grains plus watch for the new symbol packaging marking.
Dieting tips include:
	Decrease calories by 3500 calories per week or 500 calories daily to lose 1 pound.
	Calorie consumption totals not falling below 1500 for men and 1200 for women.
	Drinking milk or water before meals
	Eating more slowly as takes 20 minutes for brain to tell you fullness is near
	Drink less calorie-laden sodas, juices
	Make your plate ½ vegetables, ¼ starch, ¼ protein
	Limit protein to 6 oz. daily
	Calculating your calorie needs by determining your basal metabolic rate, sedentary/moderate/high activity rates, using number calculator factors

Portion ControlPortion control! Portion control! Hmm&#8230;What is this commonly used nutrition term? How can I make portion control work for me to win the eating nutritious foods and weight maintenance battle?
Portion control describes controlling basic daily food intake needs by consuming set amounts of food industry standard serving sizes. These standard serving sizes can further be broken down into fat or carbohydrate or protein grams to calculate total accumulated calories for a particular food or several foods consumed in a meal or day.
Standard Measurements
Your dining center uses standard serving utensils (with measures in ¹/³, ¼, ½, Â¾¾ , &amp; 1 cup) or purchased preweighed foods to control portions. Basic measurements can be compared w/ objects or measured in thickness/inches. Standard portion size examples are:
	3 oz. meat (3 ½ by 2 ½ by ½ inch thickness/size) &#8211; average hand palm size/card deck thickness
	8 oz. glass of milk or equivalent (1 cube cheese 1 inch by 1 inch size)
	½ c. cooked pasta/rice or vegetable or pudding or canned fruit (2 3/8 inch ball diameter)
	1 c. salad (closed fist)
	1 slice bread (CD case) or ½ bagel
	¾ c. cereal or soup (baseball)
	1 oz. = 1 egg or 2 tbsp. peanut butter
Keep a food journal. Write down every item consumed during meals all day long using the above portion size guidelines. This will help you in utilizing KU Dining´s NetNutrition® resource.
