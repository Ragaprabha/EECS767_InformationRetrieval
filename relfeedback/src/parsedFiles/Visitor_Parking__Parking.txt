        Visitor Permits:
&nbsp;
Visitor permits that enable a vehicle to park in Blue, Red, or Yellow lots may be purchased in our office. They can be bought in increments of: half-day ($7.50), one-day ($15), or one-week ($58).&nbsp; 
Visitor permits that allow a vehicle to park in Housing lots are available at a cost of $5 per day.&nbsp; Housing lots are restricted 24/7 Monday through Friday.&nbsp; In order to park outside a residence hall overnight, a visitor would need to purchase a two-day Housing visitor permit at a cost of ($10).&nbsp;
-Visitors may choose to park without buying a permit by taking advantage of one of the methods of hourly parking available.
&nbsp;
Visitor Metered Parking:
&nbsp;
For Traditional (Nickels, Dimes, Quarters) Meters:
There are meters located in several lots on campus, (they are marked by a meter icon on the parking map).&nbsp; 
A vehicle does not need to have a permit to park at a meter; however, all vehicles parked at meters must pay the meter, with the exception of vehicles displaying valid Accessible plates or placards.
Meters on campus accept nickels, dimes, and quarters.
	Long-term meters: Are 1-hour, 2-hour, or 10-hour and cost $1.50 per hour.&nbsp; You may find long-term meters located in lots: 1, 34, 90, 206, 210, 216, 221, 225, 228, and 111.&nbsp;
	Short-term meters (40-minute) are $.50 for 20 minutes.&nbsp; There are short-term meters located in lots 8, 35, 70, 22, 129, Green Hall Circle Drive, JRP Circle Drive and in front of the Kansas University
	If you encounter a meter that is jammed or not registering coins properly, please call us at 785-864-7289 or e-mail parkingtickets@ku.edu to report the meter number (painted on the meter) and lot location. We will send an officer to repair it.
Parkmobile
Some of the long-term metered parking stalls on campus can be paid for by mobile phone instead of coins. These meters are labeled with a green sticker that displays instructions for how to pay using Parkmobile.&nbsp; This is a service that allows users to pay for parking via mobile app (or by calling the Parkmobile number) rather than having to carry change. Parkmobile also allows the advantage of being able to add time to a meter remotely by phone, instead of having to return to the lot to manually input more coins, as well as an option to be sent text message alerts when your time is about to expire.
The hourly cost of paying to park via Parkmobile is the same as long-term meters and garages, at $1.50 per hour.&nbsp; However, there is also a $.35 transaction fee collected by Parkmobile.&nbsp; The fee is applied to each transaction.&nbsp;
Currently there are Parkmobile-enabled meters in lots 1, 19, 90, 111, 117, 206, 210, 214, 216, 221, 225, 228, 301, and 302.&nbsp; The entirety of lot 94 is also a Parkmobile-enabled zone, although the lot has no meters.&nbsp; When paying with Parkmobile, users enter the zone number posted on the meter sticker (or on the lot signs, for lot 94) as well as their license plate information.&nbsp; Ticketing officers will use an internet-enabled handheld device to check whether or not a licence plate in a Parkmobile stall has paid.&nbsp; For more information about how Parkmobile at KU works, visit the Parkmobile website.
&nbsp;
Hourly parking is also available to visitors in the Mississippi St. Garage or Allen Fieldhouse Garage.&nbsp; Parking in the garages is $1.75 for the first hour or any portion of an hour, and $1.50 per hour for all subsequent hours.
