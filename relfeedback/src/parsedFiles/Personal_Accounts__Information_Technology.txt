Personal Accounts
Most online services provided to KU faculty, staff and students require a personal account (KU Online ID and password) to use the service (e.g., KU email, Blackboard, myKU portal, etc.). Please select from the links below to manage your KU Online ID and password, KU email services and KU Directory listings. 
KU Online ID &amp; Password
Set Up New Online ID
Retrieve Forgotten Online ID
Manage Your PasswordPer the KU Password Policy, passwords may be changed at any time, but all passwords must be updated every 210 days.
Access for KUMC Students, Faculty and Staff:
KUMC students who need access to KU Lawrence systems and services (e.g., Blackboard) can complete the KUMC Student Account Request form to request a KU Lawrence Online ID. KUMC faculty and staff automatically receive KU Online IDs for Lawrence campus and do not need to complete the request form.

What Happens to My Email &amp; Accounts After I Leave KU?
Students, faculty and staff will lose access to most services and accounts—including email—210 days after they leave the University (see exceptions below).
Email notices are sent 60 days, 30 days and 7 days before accounts are deleted. You are responsible for transferring email and data to your own permanent storage prior to deletion. All emails and stored data from your KU email account and KU online services will be disposed of in accordance with KU's Record Retention Schedule policy.
Exceptions - KU Online ID &amp; Select Services:
Your KU Online ID will not be deleted and you will continue to have access to the myKU portal and select KU online services, including Blackboard and Enroll &amp; Pay. This allows you to access your employment, financial, grade and other information as needed in the future.
Exceptions - Formally Retired Faculty &amp; Staff:
Faculty and staff who formally retire from the University by completing the retirement process and paperwork via KU Human Resources will permanently retain their KU email address (i.e., @ku.edu).
