                                Nontraditional Student Services
        Welcome to the University of Kansas, we are glad you are here! For nontraditional students, life can often be quite complex, particularly student life, whether that is due to distance, multiple life roles, reduced time on campus, or simply the juggling act that goes along with being self-supporting. You might be asking yourself, am I a non-traditional student? Well, if you commute 10 or more miles to the Lawrence campus, have any dependents, a veteran, or three years older than your classmates (i.e. 21 year old freshman), then yes you are!
Nontraditional students are an important part of the diversity that makes KU a rich and interesting place. Any student can sign up to receive nontraditional information. At the Student Involvement and Leadership Center, we help ALL students explore their options, with special attention to non-traditional needs. While we can only give you a snapshot here, more information and assistance is available in our office located on the fourth floor of the Kansas Union. As student services evolve on the KU campus, we look forward to your input and to opportunities to get acquainted. Come introduce yourself!
