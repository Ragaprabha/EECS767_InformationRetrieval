        Degree Progress Report
The Degree Progress Report (DPR),&nbsp;which replaces the ARTS Form, is an online self-serve tool that allows you to track your progress toward completion of degree requirements. The generated report will
	List course work completed at KU and at other schools from which you submitted official transcripts
	List course work currently in progress
	Place course work into degree requirement sections
	Identify KU school requirements you still need to satisfy to graduate
        How to Generate Your DPR

What-If reports
To create your DPR with a different major, select "Create a new degree progress report for a What-If new field of study" and click the "Generate Report" button. This will not change your major. It will only provide you with information.
Advising appointments
Use DPR to monitor your progress and prepare for meetings with your academic adviser.&nbsp;Always consult your adviser before finalizing any decisions related to your academic plan. The DPR is for tracking your academic progress only and is not an official document.
