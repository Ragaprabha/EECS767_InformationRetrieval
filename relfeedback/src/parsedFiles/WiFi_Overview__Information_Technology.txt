Wi-Fi Overview

Campus Wi-Fi Coverage Map

Visitors with Sponsored Temporary Accounts:
KU-Passport wireless network is available exclusively to select visitors sponsored or designated by a KU faculty or staff member. KU-Passport wireless network offers a faster connection than that provided by the KUGUEST wireless network because there is no shared bandwidth limit.
Sponsor a campus visitor for KU-Passport wireless network
KU faculty and staff can request KU-Passport access for a campus visitor or group by contacting their departmental technology support staff. The technology support staff person should submit the request to the KU IT Customer Service Center.
*Campus visitors who need access to multiple online services, or who need access to KU wireless for more than a few weeks, should request a Sponsored Temporary Account. Examples include temporary workers, vendors, visiting scholar programs, summer workshops or community training programs.
