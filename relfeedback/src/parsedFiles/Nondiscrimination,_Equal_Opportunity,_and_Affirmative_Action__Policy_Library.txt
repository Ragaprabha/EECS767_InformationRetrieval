      Institutional Opportunity & Access Policy
      Nondiscrimination, Equal Opportunity, and Affirmative Action
    PolicyPurpose:&nbsp;To outline the University’s policies on nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action.
Applies to:&nbsp;All University of Kansas employees, students, volunteers, and affiliates
Campus:&nbsp;LawrenceEdwardsParsonsJuniper GardensYoderMedical Center, Kansas CityWichitaSalinaTopekaPolicy Statement:&nbsp;As a premier learning and research institution, the University of Kansas must continuously address issues of diversity and multiculturalism. Every member of the university community is expected to engage in action that leads towards the development of a more democratic and inclusive community. Proactive efforts towards increasing diversity and the elimination of discrimination are necessary in our university.
In accordance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Executive Order 11246, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Jobs for Veterans Act of 2002, the Kansas Acts Against Discrimination and all other applicable civil rights and nondiscrimination statutes, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination. Specifically, the University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression and genetic information in the University’s programs and activities. The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the non-discrimination policies: for the Lawrence, Edwards, Parsons, Yoder and Topeka campuses, contact Executive Director of the Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access, IOA@ku.edu, 1246 W. Campus Road, Room 153A, Lawrence, KS, 66045, (785)864-6414, 711 TTY; for the Medical Center campuses, contact Natalie Holick, Director, Equal Opportunity Office, Mail Stop 2014, 4330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205, 913-588-8011, 711 TTY, nholick@kumc.edu.
The University of Kansas is committed to the full participation of previously excluded or neglected classes of people. Thus, it is also the policy of the university to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, and gender expression. The university's nondiscrimination policy extends to employment practices, conditions of employment, personnel actions and all other educational programs and activities of the university and its affiliates. It also extends to any retaliatory actions by an individual and his/her associates that may arise as a result of a discrimination complaint. Leaders in the university community continuously examine all areas of the institution, make policy decisions, and implement strategies to eliminate and prevent discrimination wherever necessary. Reports of discrimination shall be evaluated promptly and acted upon in the manner deemed necessary by the appropriate faculty, staff, and administrators and as prescribed by the appropriate grievance procedure.
Equal Opportunity
The University of Kansas is also proud of its goal to help all individuals realize their potential. To this end, the university is committed to providing an equal opportunity for all qualified individuals to be considered for employment, benefits and conditions of employment, educational programs and activities, regardless of race, religion, color, ethnicity, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, age, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information. University leaders and supervisory personnel shall recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles utilizing only valid requirements related to the position functions. A university community that provides equal opportunity in hiring and all conditions of employment will make significant strides towards the elimination of discrimination. Thus, the University of Kansas applauds every effort to create a positive working and learning environment for all individuals.
Affirmative Action
In addition to providing a discrimination-free community and equal opportunity for all persons, the university is committed to taking specific, result-oriented steps to increase the number of historically underrepresented persons and increase overall diversity. Cultural and intellectual diversity are critical components of premier learning communities. Thus, the university will actively recruit and encourage applications from underrepresented group members and will endeavor to provide a positive and supportive environment for members of these groups.
The university shall monitor its efforts to increase diversity through its Affirmative Action Plans. The university's Plans shall outline strategic initiatives and set goals to increase the representation of underrepresented group members.
Paramount to the success of the affirmative action program are the actions of university leaders. University officials at all levels are expected to establish a plan and implement procedures that help to meet the university's goals. The Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access staff are charged with the responsibility of responding to complaints of discrimination, monitoring university procedures regarding equal opportunity, setting goals, and monitoring and evaluating the university's progress towards its affirmative action goals.
