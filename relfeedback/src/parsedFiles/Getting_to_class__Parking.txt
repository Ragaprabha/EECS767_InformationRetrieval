                                Getting to class
To help you plan how much time you should allow to get to your class building after you park, we've timed walking at a moderate pace from some Yellow lots.
From lot 90 to Wescoe:
From lot 125 to Wescoe:
From lot 59 to JRP:
From lot 58 to Wescoe:
From lot 94 to Fraser:
From lot 301 to Wescoe:
This map reflects a combination of walking and riding Yellow Circulator Route 41; the timing of the bus ride can vary if there is not one waiting in the lot when you park or if it is during a class change and the bus has to stop to wait for pedestrians at several crosswalks.  We clocked the total time from car door to class door as just under 13 minutes, but to be safe we recommend allowing up to 15 or 20 minutes in your time planning:
 
For more suggestions on where to park for easy access to particular buildings, e-mail kupark@ku.edu, call 785-864-7275, or tweet @parkingku.
