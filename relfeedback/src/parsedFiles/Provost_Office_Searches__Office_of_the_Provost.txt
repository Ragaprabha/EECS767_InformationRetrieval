              Foundation Professor Initiative
      The University of Kansas is investing in 12 prestigious Foundation Distinguished Professorships to become a part of KU's history of great discoveries and current collection of outstanding faculty.
They join KU faculty recognized with prestigious national and international awards, honored with campus awards and distinguished professorships; and whose research has generated more than $2.2 billion in expenditures during the past decade.
              Innovation Way
      In January 2013, the University of Kansas embarked on a year-long journey to create an updated campus master plan that puts our bold aspirations into physical form.
A major component of the plan includes creation of Innovation Way, a development zone that links existing and new science facilities and fosters an environment of multidisciplinary teaching and research and research partnerships. The project will reinforce multi-disciplinary theme-based science at KU, where collaboration with math, engineering, and social science is encouraged.
