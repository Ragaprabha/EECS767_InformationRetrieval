				This is a list of seasons completed by the Los Angeles Rams American football franchise in organized play. The list documents the season-by-season records of the Los Angeles Rams franchise from 1936 to present, including conference standings, division standings, postseason records, league awards for individual players or head coaches, and team awards for individual players. The Rams franchise was founded in Cleveland in 1936 when the team was playing in the newly formed American Football League (AFL). The franchise joined the National Football League (NFL) the following year. In 1943 operations were suspended due a depleted player roster due to World War II, and play resumed the following year. The Rams were the only team to suspend completely in 1943. The franchise has changed home cities thrice, moving to Los Angeles in 1946, moving to St. Louis in 1995, and returning to Los Angeles in 2016.
The franchise has had three periods of success in their history. The first period of came as the Cleveland Rams in NFL when they won the NFL Championship. This period continued until the 1950s as the Los Angeles Rams with them making the playoffs a further five times. The second period of success lasted over 20 years between 1966–1989 where the Rams made the playoffs 16 times and captured ten NFC Division titles including a record run of seven in a row from the 1973 season through the 1979 seasons (although the New England Patriots have since tied this record with seven straight AFC East division titles from the 2009 season through the 2015 season). However, this period of success was marred by the fact that the franchise did not win the Super Bowl and only one Conference Championship. The most recent period of success began in 1999 as the St. Louis Rams when the Rams capped a surprisingly successful season (after going 4–12 the previous year) by winning Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. This period continued until 2004 but the franchise failed to win another Super Bowl and suffered a surprise defeat to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI.
Alternating with their successful periods, the Rams have experienced severe periods of failure. As the NFL Cleveland Rams they failed to record a single winning season until their final year in the city, whilst from 1956 to 1965 they never won as many games as they lost and in 1962 won just one game. Between 1990 and 1998, affected in part by failure to obtain stadium improvements in Los Angeles and a move to Missouri, the Rams had nine consecutive losing seasons, and since 2005 after the collapse of “The Greatest Show on Turf” have not had a single winning season. Their three-season record between 2007 and 2009 of 6–42 is the worst over such a period since the Chicago Cardinals during World War II.
Over the course of the Rams’ 71-year history,[1] they have won 15 division titles. They have appeared in the postseason 27 times, winning three NFL Championships. During the Super Bowl era, they have played in three Super Bowls, winning one.

Footnotes[edit]
^ The Rams spent one year in the AFL and seventy years in the NFL. The NFL does not officially recognize the one year they spent in the AFL.
^ Boston Shamrocks forfeit Championship game due to players strike. Rams win championship by default. However, the Shamrocks, who finished with the best regular season record, are usually credited as the league champs in most subsequent records.
^ "The Cleveland Rams: Remembering the Original L.A. Move &amp; a Rivalry Born".
^ Dan Reeves moved the team due to poor attendance; the Rams became the first NFL team based on the West Coast.
^ 1982 was a strike-shortened season so the league was divided up into two conferences instead of its normal divisional alignment.
^ The strike of 1987 reduced the regular season schedule from sixteen to fifteen games.
^ The team had new logo featuring the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial for this season to honor the move to St. Louis
^ This was Dick Vermeil's first season as head coach of the team.
^ The team became known as The Greatest Show on Turf during this season.
^ This game featured The Tackle
^ The team changed their colors to metallic gold and navy for this season
^ a b 1937–present, excludes AFL team.
