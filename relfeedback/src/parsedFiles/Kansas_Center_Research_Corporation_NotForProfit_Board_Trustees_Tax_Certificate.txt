                                University of Kansas Center for Research, Inc.
        KU Center for Research, Inc. (KUCR) is the entity responsible for submitting all proposals for external support of research, instructional and service projects. In addition, KUCR helps research investigators by negotiating contracts, providing proposal and post-award services, administering compliance oversight, managing and constructing research facilities, and handling financial services, including investment of corporation resources.
 KUCR is a not-for-profit research foundation that operates for the benefit of the university under the administrative jurisdiction of the University of Kansas Office of Research. KUCR was incorporated in 1962 to develop and administer sponsored programs in engineering and related interdisciplinary areas at KU. Effective July 1, 1997, KUCR's services expanded to encompass all sponsored programs conducted throughout the Lawrence campus.
KUCR is governed by a Board of Trustees that includes university and public members. The elected officers of the Board are KU administrators. The Vice Chancellor for the Office of Research serves as the President and Chief Operating Officer of KUCR. An Executive Committee meets quarterly and, in the absence of the trustees, has oversight of the budget and general operation of the corporation. A Finance and Audit Committee meets quarterly to review the investments and operations of the corporation and reports to the Executive Committee.
