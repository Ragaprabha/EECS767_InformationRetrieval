Welcome to the University of Kansas
You have made an excellent choice to attend the University of Kansas. The Office of First-Year Experience works with you as you transition into the university. Our programs are designed to challenge and support students across the first year and to connect you to outstanding learning opportunities that will help you to achieve your academic goals.
Your education at KU means far more than grades. You will acquire confidence in asking questions and thinking critically. You will engage with viewpoints different than your own and discover how collaboration across disciplines can help us to solve some of society’s most complicated problems. You will also have transformative experiences that extend your learning beyond the classroom, such as study abroad, undergraduate research, and service learning.
There is much to look forward to during your first year at KU. First-Year Experience programs connect you to outstanding faculty, staff, and fellow students. We invite you to read more about our programs and to contact us with questions. We look forward to seeing what you achieve at KU.
