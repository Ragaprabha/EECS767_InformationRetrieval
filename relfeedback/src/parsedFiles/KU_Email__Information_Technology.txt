Email notices are sent 60 days, 30 days and 7 days before accounts are deleted. You are responsible for transferring email and data to your own permanent storage prior to deletion. All emails and stored data from your KU email account and KU online services will be disposed of in accordance with KU's Record Retention Schedule policy.
Exceptions - KU Online ID &amp; Select Services:
Your KU Online ID will not be deleted and you will continue to have access to the myKU portal and select KU online services, including Blackboard and Enroll &amp; Pay. This allows you to access your employment, financial, grade and other information as needed in the future.
Exceptions - Formally Retired Faculty &amp; Staff:
Faculty and staff who formally retire from the University by completing the retirement process and paperwork via KU Human Resources will permanently retain their KU email address (i.e., @ku.edu). Faculty and staff who leave the University without completing the formal retirement process and paperwork will lose access to most services and accounts 210 days after they leave the University as stated above.
