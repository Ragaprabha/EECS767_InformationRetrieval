Tips For Better Sleeping 
Sleep has a profound impact on our mood and emotional resilience. In fact, a large scale research study found that having a poor nights' sleep decreases our chances of experiencing a self-reported "good day" by over half. Although the amount of sleep each person needs varies some, most people require between seven and eight hours of sleep each night. The following are some suggestions for helping with good sleep. &nbsp;
	Have a routine.&nbsp;As much as possible, get up at the approximately the same time and go to bed at the same time each night. On week-ends try to stick within an hour of your week-day schedule.&nbsp;
	Sleep only when you are tired.&nbsp; If you have not fallen asleep within twenty minutes of getting into bed, get up and find something else to do.&nbsp; Read, talk to a friend, etc. until you feel tired enough to go to sleep. Staying in bed trying to force sleep can start to create the association of being in bed with frustration, not with sleep.
	Only use your bed for sleeping.&nbsp; Watch TV, read and do homework in a separate location.&nbsp; Again, create the association of your bed with sleep.
	Exercise on a regular basis.&nbsp;Exercise helps with many things, including reducing anxiety, improving sleep, and increasing energy. &nbsp;
	Avoid taking naps.&nbsp; Research clearly indicates sleeping during the day will make it more difficult for you to fall asleep at night. If you are in the habit of taking naps, it may be difficult for the first few days, but it will be worth the effort.
