                                eduroam
        ContainerOverviewThe University of Kansas has joined a global consortium of nearly 6,000 institutions offering quick and easy access to local Wi-Fi networks. eduroam is a network access system developed for the international research and education community and currently available in 58 countries.
Anyone with a KU Online ID can quickly and easily access the Internet via eduroam at U.S. locations and international locations. And, visitors from other eduroam institutions can connect to our Wi-Fi network using the login credentials from their home institutions.
The security of eduroam significantly exceeds most public hotspots (i.e., coffee shops, etc.). However, be aware that anytime you are using the Internet at an eduroam access point, the security measures in place are set by that eduroam member institution. Campus visitors connecting to eduroam at KU enjoy the same security and speed of the Jayhawk network used by faculty, staff and students. When using eduroam, be aware that security settings at other institutions may be different and you may have access to fewer services on the Internet than you do here on campus.&nbsp;
While KU is the first institution in the central United States and only the second Big 12 school to participate, more and more schools are joining eduroam, providing even more locations where KU students, faculty and staff can access the Internet when traveling.
Visit the official eduroam website for more information.
Eligibility:
Departments
Faculty &amp; Staff
Graduate Research &amp; Teaching Assistants

Undergraduate Students
Visitors to Campus &nbsp;
AccessConfigure your device for eduroam
To set up eduroam access on your laptop or mobile device, select from the following list of step-by-step instructions (by operating system) in the KU IT Knowledge Base or contact the campus technical representative for your unit:
Eduroam step-by-step instructions (by operating system) in KU IT Knowledge Base
	Windows 7
	Mac OSX
	iOS devices
	Android devices
Test Before You Travel
Before visiting another eduroam institution, you should log into eduroam here at KU to ensure your can connect on your mobile device or laptop.
When you return to KU, be sure to connect to Wi-Fi on the secure JAYHAWK network.
Logging in to eduroam
Once you've configured your device (see above), accessing eduroam&nbsp;is almost exactly the same as accessing secure JAYHAWK wireless here on campus, but you'll need to add "@home.ku.edu" after your online ID. (Note: Your Online ID is not always the same as your email alias.) For example, if your online ID is "a123b456," you would log in using "a123b456@home.ku.edu," even though your email alias may be different. If your online ID is an older format, such as jdoe, you would login using "jdoe@home.ku.edu" even though the email alias you use may be "janedoe@ku.edu."
SupportSupport is available through the KU Information Technology Customer Service Center: itcsc@ku.edu&nbsp; | 785-864-8080.
eduroam Support for Visitors
