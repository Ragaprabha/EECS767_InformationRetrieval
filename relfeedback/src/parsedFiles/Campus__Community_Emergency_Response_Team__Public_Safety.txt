                                Campus - Community Emergency Response Team 
The University of Kansas Campus Emergency Response Team is activated whenever there is a critical incident on campus that could affect the safety, health or well-being of people on campus.
&nbsp;
About C-CERT&nbsp;
The Campus - Community Emergency Response Team – composed of various campus officials – focuses primarily on the management of situations involving critical incidents on campus. Its involvement supports the successful implementation of the Emergency Management Plan.&nbsp;
CERT Responsibilities
In an emergency, the highest priority is ensuring the health, safety and well-being of people on and off campus. After the University acts to protect the safety of individuals on campus, University facilities, and property are the next highest priority, followed by private property that may be affected by the situation. After the situation has stabilized and the University has secured the safety of people and property, the University’s primary goal will be to return to normal operations. During all phases of the emergency and disaster response, there are challenges that must be overcome to complete the recovery process. Having sufficient trained personnel is a challenge in most major disasters, and to mitigate that risk we have created the C-CERT program.&nbsp;
In an emergency, C-CERT will:
&nbsp;
	Monitor an emergency situation and directs University responses to resolve and respond to the emergency quickly and with as little adverse impact as possible at the direction of the Incident Commander.
	Assists the Incident Commander by providing support and resources via the Incident Command System (ICS).
	Gather, confirm and evaluate incident information.
	Define and implement tactics/actions to resolve priority situations.
	Identify resource needs and shortfalls.
	Reassign/deploy individuals in support of critical needs.
	Issue public information reports and instructions; serve as liaison to other emergency service providers.
	Balance various needs and requests.
	Provide technical, legal, and fiscal expertise as necessary.
When needed, and in coordination with KU Emergency Management, C-CERT will coordinate University efforts with the Douglas County Office of Emergency Management. CERT will continue to monitor and coordinate events until the emergency situation is stabilized sufficiently to allow a return to regular organizational operation. At an appropriate time, CERT debriefs with each of the units involved in an emergency in an ongoing effort to improve the University response to crisis situations.
