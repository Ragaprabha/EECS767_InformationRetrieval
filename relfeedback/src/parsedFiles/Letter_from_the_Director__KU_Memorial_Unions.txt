			Welcome to the KU Memorial Unions! We offer two venues, the Kansas Union and the DeBruce Center with the ability to host 2 to 1000 people in our 26 meeting spaces.   Stay tuned as we are also working to open a student union in the Central District that will offer an 11,000 square foot ballroom opening in the fall of 2018!
Space is just the beginning. Our staff is here to assist from the reservation to your arrival and throughout your meeting or event. Our meeting rooms are constantly updated to assure we are offering what you need to host your event.
