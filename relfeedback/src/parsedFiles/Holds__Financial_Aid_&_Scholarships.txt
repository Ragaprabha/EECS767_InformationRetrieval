                                Holds
        Past Due Balance
You owe KU money. Hold will remain on the account until the amount is paid in full. Blocks initial enrollment. No transcript or diploma issued. 
Pay online or at cashier office on appropriate campus:
KUMC: Student Financial Acctg, 120 Support Services Building, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mon-Fri.
Lawrence: Cashier/Student Account Service's Office, 23 Strong Hall, 8:10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mon-Fri, 9:40 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thur.
Student Loan Hold KULC
You have a past due amount on your Perkins Loan. Contact the Student Account Service's Office to resolve your hold, 785-864-3322.
Hold may be due to the following circumstances:
If a Perkins/HPSL/LDS loan is 90 days past due, a "Past Due" hold is placed on their student account. This hold remains on their account until the past due amount is paid in full. This hold blocks initial enrollment. No transcripts and diplomas issued.
	When a Perkins/HPSL/LDS borrower graduates, leaves or drops below half-time status, they are required to do an Exit Interview for their loan. Federal Regulations require this. An "Exit Interview" hold is placed on their academic records until this is completed. This hold will remain on the account until the requirements are satisfied. Hold blocks initial enrollment. No transcripts and diplomas issued.
	Once a Perkins/HPSL/LDS loan has been placed with an outside collection agency, a "Default" hold is placed on their student account. The hold remains on their account until the entire outstanding balance of the loan is paid in full. Hold blocks initial enrollment. No transcripts and diplomas issued.
Student Account Service's Hold
Contact the Student Account Service's Office, 785-864-3322. Blocks initial enrollment. No transcripts and diplomas issued.
Student Account Service's hold reflects past non payment status on the student account. Hold will remain on the account until past due amount is paid in full. Must pay by cash, certified funds, or credit card online. If payment is by personal paper check or online echeck, the account holder will be required to wait until the payment has cleared the bank (up to 2 weeks) to enroll or secure transcript or a diploma. Hold blocks initial enrollment. No transcript or diplomas issued.
Returned Check
No personal checks accepted. Must pay by cash, certified funds or credit card online.
