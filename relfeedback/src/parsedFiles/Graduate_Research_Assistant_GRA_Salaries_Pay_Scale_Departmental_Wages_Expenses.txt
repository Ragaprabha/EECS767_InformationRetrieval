	A MA student will do research in the Department of Human Development. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The research plan should have a scope and depth appropriate to MA level thesis work. The GRA will be expected to a) perform limited experimental and/or theoretical work, b) provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI, c) meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project, and d) follow all safety regulations and rules, human and nonhuman, and attend all training and safety sessions appropriate for the laboratory and research project.
	Pre-Comp-Ph.D.
	A Pre-Comp-Ph.D. will do research in the Department of Human Development. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The research plan should have a scope and depth appropriate to the eventual production of a Ph.D. thesis. The GRA will be expected to a) perform limited experimental and/or theoretical work, b) provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI, c) meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project, and d) follow all safety regulations and rules, human and nonhuman, and attend all training and safety sessions appropriate for the laboratory and research project.
	Post-Comp-PhD (&lt;1 yr. experience)
	A Post-Comp Ph.D. with less than one year experience will do research in the Department of Human Development. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research.

Chemistry GRA Salary Policy
	MS
	A MS student will be doing laboratory research in a division of chemistry. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The research plan should have a scope and depth appropriate to Master’s level thesis work. The GRA will be expected to perform limited experimental and/or theoretical work planned. Provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI. Meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project. The GRA is expected to follow all safety regulations and rules, human and animal. Attend all training and safety sessions appropriate for the laboratory and research project.
	Pre-Comp-Ph.D.
	A Pre-Comp-Ph.D. student will be doing laboratory research in a division of chemistry. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The research plan should have a scope and depth appropriate to the eventual production of a Ph.D. thesis. The GRA will be expected to perform limited experimental and/or theoretical work planned. Provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI. Meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project. The GRA is expected to follow all safety regulations and rules, human and animal. Attend all training and safety sessions appropriate for the laboratory and research project.
	Post-Comp-PhD (&lt;1 yr. experience)
	A Post-Comp-Ph.D. student with less than one year experience will be doing laboratory research in a division of chemistry. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The GRA will be expected to perform moderate experimental and/or theoretical work planned. Provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI. Meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project. The GRA is expected to follow all safety regulations and rules, human and animal. Attend all training and safety sessions appropriate for the laboratory and research project.
	Post-Comp-PhD (&gt;1 yr. experience)
	A Post-Comp-Ph.D. student with more than one year experience will be doing laboratory research in a division of chemistry. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The GRA will be expected to perform advanced experimental and/or theoretical work planned. Provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI. Meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project. The GRA is expected to follow all safety regulations and rules, human and animal. Attend all training and safety sessions appropriate for the laboratory and research project.
	Probationary GRA
	A Probationary GRA student will be participating in the research enhancement program in chemisty. The GRA will work closely with the principal investigator (PI), on the project to develop a working plan to accomplish the goals and objectives of the research. The GRA will be expected to perform very limited experimental and/or theoretical work planned. Provide written and/or oral progress reports on a timely and regular basis as agreed upon by the GRA and PI. Meet with the PI to discuss progress, changes in direction, and other aspects of the research project. The GRA is expected to follow all safety regulations and rules, human and animal.
