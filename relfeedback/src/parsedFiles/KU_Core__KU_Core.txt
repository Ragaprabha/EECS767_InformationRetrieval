        KU Core
Beginning in fall 2013, the KU Core defines the educational goals integrated into all of the degrees and majors pursued by undergraduate students at the University of Kansas. The KU Core is designed to yield fundamental skills, build a broad background of knowledge, generate capacities and opportunities for blending and creating ideas, strengthen an appreciation of cultural and global diversity, and cultivate ethical integrity.
Each of the KU Core’s six educational goals has one or more distinct learning outcomes, which can be met by a variety of courses and educational experiences. Fulfilling the requirements of the KU Core entails successfully completing 12 units across the six education goals. General education goals are best met early in a student’s undergraduate career. Advanced education goals are most appropriately acquired using the foundation of knowledge gained from the general education goals and progression through the major. The sixth goal, Integration and Creativity, can provide a capstone experience.
How to use this web site
The six goals and their associated learning outcomes are at Goals.  You can also find information there on the criteria used to determine whether a course or experience meets a goal or learning outcome.
Lists of approved courses and experiences are at Fulfilling the Core, along with information on exemptions from the KU Core.  Students may use this page to plan their courses of study. 
Information on the University Core Curriculum Committee, the body responsible for developing, sustaining, and overseeing the KU Core, is at Committee.
Faculty, schools, and departments may nominate courses and experiences for the KU Core through the Nominations page. 
The KU Core is housed in the Office of Undergraduate Studies.
