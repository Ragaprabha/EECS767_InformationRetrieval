Cuyahoga Valley National Park is a United States national park that preserves and reclaims the rural landscape along the Cuyahoga River between Akron and Cleveland in Northeast Ohio. The 20,339.22-acre (8,231ha)[1] park is administered by the National Park Service and is the only national park in Ohio. It was established in 1974 as the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area and was designated as a national park in 2000.
Native Americans called this winding water "Kahyonhá:ke," which means "on the river" or "at the river" in Mohawk. Cuyahoga is an English spelling of Kahyonhá:ke. The English often write Cu for Ga, ya for yon, ho for ha, and ga for ke. The area from Sandusky Bay to Cleveland is described as Canahoque: The Seat of War, The Mart of Trade, &amp; Chief Hunting Grounds of the six New York Iroquois on the Lakes &amp; the Ohio.[3]

Administrative history[edit]
The valley began providing recreation for urban dwellers in the 1870s when people came from nearby cities for carriage rides or leisure boat trips along the canal. In 1880, the Valley Railroad became another way to escape urban industrial life. Actual park development began in the 1910s and 1920s with the establishment of Cleveland and Akron metropolitan park districts. In 1929 the estate of Cleveland businessman Hayward Kendall donated 430 acres (170ha) around the Richie Ledges and a trust fund to the state of Ohio. Kendall's will stipulated that the "property should be perpetually used for park purposes". It became Virginia Kendall park, in honor of his mother. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps built much of the park's infrastructure including what are now Happy Days Lodge and the shelters at Octagon, Ledges, and Kendall Lake.
Although the regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley's natural beauty. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to find a long-term solution. Finally, on December 27, 1974, President Gerald Ford signed the bill establishing the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.
The National Park Service acquired the 47-acre (19ha) Krejci Dump in 1985 to include as part of the recreation area. They requested a thorough analysis of the site's contents from the Environmental Protection Agency. After the survey identified extremely toxic materials, the area was closed in 1986 and designated a superfund site.[4] Litigation was filed against potentially responsible parties, which included Ford, GM, Chrysler, 3M, and Waste Management of Ohio. All the companies except 3M agreed to a settlement; 3M lost at trial.[5]
Cleanup began in 1987 and had not been completed as of mid-2011, although most of the area had been restored to its original state as wetlands.[6]
The area was redesignated a national park by Congress on October 11, 2000,[7] with the passage of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, House Bill 4578, 106th congress.[8] It is administered by the National Park Service. David Berger National Memorial in Beachwood, Ohio is also managed through Cuyahoga Valley National Park.
The Richfield Coliseum, a multipurpose arena in the Cuyahoga River area, was demolished in 1999 and the now-empty site became part of Cuyahoga Valley National Park upon its designation in 2000. It has since become a grassy meadow popular with birdwatchers.
Attractions[edit]
The Towpath Trail provides recreational activities for visitors
Many visitors spend their time hiking or bicycling the park's many trails which visit its numerous attractions, including the crushed limestone along portions of the 20-mile (32km) Towpath Trail, following a former stretch of the 308-mile (496km) Ohio and Erie Canal.
Waterfalls, rolling hills, caves and winding river scenery attract many park visitors. Steep narrow ravines, a rolling floodplain, and lush farmland contrast with one another throughout the park. Animal life is also plentiful. The Ledges provides a boulder-strewn cliff to relax and watch the sunset over the wooded scenery below. Sled-riding is popular during the winter at Kendall Hills.[9]
The park offers an array of preserved and restored displays of 19th and early 20th century sustainable farming and pastoral or rural living, while catering to contemporary interests with art exhibits, outdoor concerts, and scenic excursion and special event railroad tours on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad.[10]
It includes compatible-use sites not owned by the federal government, including several local regional parks in the Cleveland Metroparks and Metro Parks, Serving Summit County systems, Blossom Music Center, and the Hale Farm &amp; Village. In the mid-1980s, the park hosted the National Folk Festival.
Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail[edit]
The multi-purpose Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Towpath trail was developed by the National Park Service and is the major trail through Cuyahoga Valley National Park. It runs almost 21 miles (33½ km) from Rockside Road, Independence, OH in the north to Summit County's Bike &amp; Hike trail in the south. It follows the Cuyahoga River for much of its length. Restrooms can be found at several trailheads along the way and commercial food and drink can be found on Rockside Rd., the Boston Store, in Peninsula, and at the farmer's market on Botzum Rd., (seasonally). There are also several visitors centers along the way. At Rockside Rd. it connects to Cleveland Metroparks trail which travels another 6 miles (9½ km) North. The Summit County trail runs through Akron and south. The "towpath trail" continues through Stark and Tuscarawas counties down to Zoar, Ohio; almost 70 more miles with only one significant (1 mile) interruption. Sections of the towpath trail outside of Cuyahoga Valley National Park are owned and maintained by various state and local agencies. The trail also meets the Buckeye Trail in the National Park (near Boston Store). Another section of the Summit County Bike &amp; Hike Trail system (connecting to the nearby Brandywine Falls, and also to the Cleveland Metroparks Bedford Reservation and Solon in Cuyahoga County; Hudson and Stow in Summit County; and Kent and Ravenna in Portage County, Ohio) is near-by.
Seasonally, the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad allows visitors to travel along the towpath from Rockside Rd. to Akron getting off/on at any of the 6 other stops along the way. This is especially popular with bikers and for viewing and photographing fall colors. CVSR is independently owned and operated. (note - as of May, 2014, flood damage has limited the train to the 6 stops north of Indigo Lake Station. The entire route to Akron is expected to be open shortly.)
History[edit]
Restored Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Lock
The Towpath Trail follows the historic route of the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal. Before the canal was built, Ohio was a sparsely settled wilderness where travel was difficult and getting crops to market was nearly impossible. The canal, built between 1825 and 1832, provided a successful transportation route from Cleveland, on Lake Erie, to Portsmouth, on the Ohio River. The canal opened up Ohio to the rest of the settled eastern United States.[11]
There are numerous wayside exhibits that provide information about canal features and sites of historic interest.[12] There is also a virtual tour.[11][13]
Today visitors can walk or ride along the same path that the mules used to tow the canal boats loaded with goods and passengers. The scene is different than it was then; the canal was full of water carrying a steady flow of boats amongst the constant conversations of "canawlers." Evidence of beavers can be seen in many places along the trail.[11]
Stanford House (Formerly Stanford Hostel)[edit]
Stanford House located in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Ohio
Located in the scenic Cuyahoga Valley near Peninsula, Ohio, Stanford House is a historic 19th-century farm home built in the 1830s by George Stanford, one of the first settlers in the Western Reserve. In 1978, the NPS purchased the property to act as a youth hostel in conjunction with the American Youth Hostels (AYH) organization. In March 2011, Stanford Hostel became Stanford House, Cuyahoga Valley National Park's first in-park lodging facility. The home was renovated by the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park[14] and the National Park Service.[15][16]

north of State Route 303
The Peninsula Depot was originally located in the village of Boston, just north of Boston Mills Road. It was moved to Peninsula in the late 1960s. The building may be the only surviving combination station from the Valley Railway, which operated between Cleveland, Ohio and Tuscarawas County, Ohio in the late 19th century. Today the Peninsula Depot serves as an information and orientation center for people on foot, bike, and rail, and serves as a station for Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad (CVSR) excursions. Exhibits highlight the history and recreational opportunities of the area.

Canal Visitor Center - "Hell's Half Acre"
Exhibits related to human history in the valley and Ohio &amp; Erie Canal history are available at Canal Visitor Center. The exhibits are housed in a renovated canal-era tavern that, for some time, had such a colorful reputation that it came to be called "Hell's Half Acre." Lock 38 is located in the front; lock demonstrations are offered by volunteers and staff in period costume every Saturday, Sunday, and holiday during the summer months. A lock model is located inside the visitor center. The ranger at the information desk will perform lock model demonstrations on request. An auditorium in the basement is used to show three different canal-related videos and one park orientation slide program. These programs will be run on request.[19]
Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Related Structures
The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal was constructed between 1825 and 1832. It successfully provided Ohio with a transportation system that permitted residents to conduct trade with the world. While it stopped functioning after the Great Flood of 1913, remnants and ruins of canal-related structures can be seen alongside the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Towpath Trail. Wayside exhibits explain the function of many of the structures visible from the trail. Our Towpath Trail Sites to Visit list may be useful in directing you to the points of greatest interest.[20][21]
Frazee House
The Frazee House was under construction in 1825 when the canal was dug through its front yard. It's a great place to visit for information about Western Reserve architecture and construction techniques as well as some tidbits about the Frazee family.[22]
Boston Store
This early canal-era building was owned by the Boston Land &amp; Manufacturing Company. The Boston Store now houses numerous exhibits relating to canal boat building.[23]
Everett Road Covered Bridge
The Everett Road Covered Bridge was constructed after a local resident was killed attempting to cross the swollen Furnace Run in 1877. It was destroyed by storm floodwaters in 1975 and reconstructed by the National Park Service in 1986. It is the only covered bridge in Summit County today. The bridge is located on Everett Road about 1⁄2 mile (800m) west of Riverview Road near Everett Village.[24]
Brandywine Village
Brandywine Village was conceived and founded by George Wallace, who built a sawmill next to Brandywine Falls in 1814. He encouraged others to move to the area, including his brother-in-law, who built a grist mill on the opposite side of the falls. With inexpensive land available and the presence of mills to provide lumber, flour, and corn meal, the Village of Brandywine began to grow. Today only a couple of buildings remain from the village but historic photos and remnants of building foundations allow us to remember the Brandywine Village that once was.[25]
Civilian Conservation Corps Structures
The Civilian Conservation Corps was responsible for the construction of some of the most attractive buildings in the valley. Happy Days Visitor Center as well as the Ledges, Octagon, and Lake Shelters were built of wormy American Chestnut wood in the late 1930s. These structures can be found in the Virginia Kendall Unit of the park.[26][27]
The George Stanford House
James Stanford moved to Boston Township immediately after surveying and naming it in 1806. He and with his wife Polly and son George were the first homesteaders in what is today Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP). His son George built a stately Greek revival home in about 1830. That home, located at 6093 Stanford Road, now serves as the Cuyahoga Valley HI-Stanford Hostel.[28]
National Register of Historic Places
This page contains a complete list of National Register of Historic Places locations within CVNP. Some of these locations are privately owned.[29]
Hale Farm &amp; Village
Hale Farm &amp; Village is an outdoor living history museum that is just a few miles and 150 years away. Costumed "pioneer" interpreters describe life in the Western Reserve during the formative years of the United States of America. The village features 21 historic buildings to tour and many talented craftspeople. It is operated by the Western Reserve Historical Society.
Craft demonstrations include glassblowing, candlemaking, broommaking, spinning &amp; weaving, cheesemaking, blacksmithing, woodworking, sawmilling, hearth cooking, and pottery making. The farm also features oxen, sheep, cows, and gardens.[30]
