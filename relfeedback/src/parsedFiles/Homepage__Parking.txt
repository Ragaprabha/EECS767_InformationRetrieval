*UPDATE: Online Permit Purchasing Will Be Temporary Offline 4/29.*
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Students-- Our permit purchasing portal will be temporary down starting Friday evening running through 5/2, while we make it more user friendly! Please bear with us as we make these changes. If you need to purchase a permit while our portal is down, please come into the office and we will take care of you! Once our portal is back up it may look different! (However do not fear, it should run smoother with our new software.) We apologize for the inconvenience

New Allocation of Commuter Student Parking: Fall 2016-Spring 2017
WHY
As a yellow permit holder, you may remember the fall semester began with very crowded conditions in lot 90 near the Student Fitness and Recreation Center.&nbsp; This crowding was caused by the loss of parking on Daisy Hill which created a domino effect spreading to nearby lots.&nbsp; We heard reports of yellow permit holders who circled lot 90 for up to 30 minutes to find parking.&nbsp; At the same time however, parking lots to the west of lot 90, and near the stadium, experienced much lower volume of traffic.
&nbsp;
This semester we have lost yet more parking; in Stouffer Place and Jayhawker Towers.&nbsp; Over the summer, we will lose half of lot 72 (between former Burge Union and Allen Fieldhouse parking garage).
&nbsp;
WHAT
The 2016 school year is going to present even greater parking challenges.&nbsp; To resolve the circling and hunting that our current parking permit system causes, the Parking Commission has approved a new system of permit allocation, whereby students will be assigned parking for specific parking lots, grouped by area.
&nbsp;
HOW
When you check into the MyKU portal to purchase a permit, you will see the following permit options:
Recreation Center South (this includes lot 90)
Allen Fieldhouse South (this includes lots 71, 125, 127)
Stadium East (this includes lots 53, 92, 94)
Stadium West (this includes lots 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 and 65)
West Campus (this includes all yellow lots on West Campus)
Park &amp; Ride (this includes lot 301 on West Campus)
The portal will allow you to click on a link for each of these areas to see which lots are included in each permit option.
Each area will have a specified number of parking permits available.&nbsp; Once this number is met, the option will no longer appear.&nbsp; A waiting list option will take its place.We will conduct occupancy counts of all of these parking areas on a regular basis at the beginning of the semester.&nbsp; If we find that parking lots are not fully utilized, we will begin filling in from waiting lists.
WHEN
Permit selection and purchase will begin May – a subsequent e-mail will be sent out when permit sales open up.
Due to central district construction, there have been updated restrictions for the 2016&nbsp;Spring Semester for residents of Daisy Hill and Jayhawker Towers. Please refer to the maps below for details. 
Lots 19, 20, 114 (north), and 123 closed on March 6, 2016. Jayhawker Towers permits are now valid to park in lot 72, east of the Burge Union.
Residents of Daisy Hill can consult the Daisy Hill parking maps to see which lots their permit is allowed to park in; residents of other halls (including Jayhawker&nbsp;Towers)&nbsp;can check the Residence Hall parking maps.
The portion of Lot 112 immediately west of Oliver Hall closed on March 10, 2016 due to Central District construction.&nbsp; A new gravel lot has been constructed for the displaced Oliver Hall and McCarthy Hall residents.&nbsp; See map below.
        Current Restrictions
Traffic on Jayhawk Boulevard is restricted 7:45am-5:00pm Monday through Friday.
Parking in Yellow lots is restricted 8:00am-4:00pm Monday through Friday and parking in Red, Blue, and Gold lots will still be restricted from 7 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday (some Blue and Gold lots are restricted for staff permits only until 7:30 PM). 
Permits can be purchased online.
