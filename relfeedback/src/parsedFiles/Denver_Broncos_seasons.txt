List of Denver Broncos seasons - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Sports Authority Field at Mile High, where the Broncos have played their home games since 2001
This is a list of seasons completed by the Denver Broncos, an American football franchise based in Denver, Colorado. The Broncos are members of the West division of the American Football Conference (AFC) of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents their season-by-season records from 1960 to the present day, including post-season records, and league awards for individual players and head coaches. As of the end of the 2015 season, the team has completed 56 seasons (playing in nearly 900 combined regular season and playoff games), and concluded the 2015 season with a 24–10 victory over the Carolina Panthers at Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara, California.
The Broncos franchise was founded on August 14, 1959, by Bob Howsam and played their first season in 1960, in Denver, Colorado as part of the original American Football League (AFL). The team joined the NFL in 1970 as a result of the AFL–NFL merger.[1]
The franchise has experienced two major periods of success. The first was from 1976 to 1981, when the Broncos did not have a losing season (a season when the team has more losses than wins), and won two AFC West division titles, and one AFC championship. The second began in 1983 and ended in 1998. During this period, the Broncos had just two losing seasons, were AFC champions five times and were Super Bowl champions for two consecutive years. This second period of success is best remembered for John Elway being the team's quarterback.[2] The Broncos have also experienced one notable period of deterioration. From their inaugural season in 1960 until 1975, they did not make either the AFL playoffs or NFL playoffs and had just two winning seasons. The Broncos were the only charter AFL franchise to never have a winning season during the AFL's ten years of existence (although the team finished with at 7-7 in 1962), with their first winning season not occurring until 1973, their fourth year as a member of the NFL's AFC. They also experienced their two seasons with the fewest wins ever, winning just two of 14 games in both 1963 and 1964.[3]
The Broncos have been AFC West champions 15 times, most recently having won the division the last five consecutive seasons (2011 to present), and have also earned wild card berths into the playoffs seven times, for a total of 22 playoff appearances. They have been conference champions eight times (tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots for the most AFC championships) and Super Bowl champions thrice.[3]

Footnotes[edit]
^ As a result of the AFL-NFL Merger, the league was broken into two conferences, with the AFL teams moving into the American Football Conference.[4]
^ Due to the 1982 strike-shortened season, the league was broken up into two conferences instead of its normal divisional alignment.[5]
^ This game included The Drive, where quarterback John Elway led the Broncos on a 98-yard drive to tie the game with less than a minute left.[6]
^ The strike of 1987 reduced the regular season schedule from sixteen to fifteen games.[5]
^ This game included The Fumble, where Cleveland Browns' running back Earnest Byner fumbled at the Broncos' 3-yard line, enabling the Broncos to win the game.[7]
