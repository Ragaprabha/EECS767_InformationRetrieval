This article is a compilation of the list of seasons completed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, an American football franchise based in Tampa, Florida. The Buccaneers are members of the South division in the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents the season-by-season records of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' franchise from 1976 to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches.
The Buccaneers first joined the NFL in 1976 as members of the AFC West. The following year, they moved to the NFC Central. The Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The front office staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.
The Buccaneers won one Super Bowl championship: in 2002. This was the teams' only Super Bowl appearance, having reached the NFC conference championship on two other occasions. The Buccaneers have been divisional champions six times, three of them in the NFC Central and the other three in NFC South. They were the first team to win the NFC South after the NFL restructure in 2002. In their 40-year history, the Buccaneers have played over 500 regular and post-season games and have appeared in the post-season ten times.
