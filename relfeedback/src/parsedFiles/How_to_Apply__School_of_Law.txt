                                How to Apply
Juris Doctor
Visit the tabs below to learn about the application requirements for the Juris Doctor program. See the links at left for application instructions for other KU Law degree programs.
Application
	Opt'l Statements
	Deadlines
	Admission
	Tuition
	Fee Waivers
The application is available electronically through the LSAC. Once you have met the Admission Requirements, you must submit:
The completed and electronically signed application for admission.
	 
	Two letters of recommendation. If you graduated from college within the past three years, at least one letter should come from a college professor. If you graduated more than three years ago, it is acceptable to provide letters from professional colleagues. We will accept up to three letters. Your letters of recommendation must be submitted through the Credential Assembly Service (CAS). The letters of recommendation service is included in your CAS registration subscription. 
	 
	A personal statement. Your personal statement is your opportunity to share with the Admissions Committee your significant personal, social or academic experiences that demonstrate why you are interested in attending law school and what qualities you will bring to our campus. Please attach a two- to three-page, double-spaced statement reflecting your interest in seeking a J.D. and in joining our community.
	 
	Resume. Please attach a resume to your application that includes all of your relevant education, work experience, volunteer activities, honors, scholarships, awards and other activities that reflect your background and experience.
	 
	Supplemental KU Law application for international students (for preparing your I-20)
	For international students only.
		Download the form.
		Submit directly to admitlaw@ku.edu.
		 
	The $55 non-refundable application fee. The application fee should be paid online through your LSAC.org account. Get information about fee waivers.
	 
	Official transcripts of all collegiate, graduate and professional study must be sent directly to the CAS.
	 
	Character &amp; Fitness. All candidates must establish their character and fitness to serve as an officer of the court upon graduation. The application includes six detailed questions that request full disclosure of any character and fitness issues you may have. These can include juvenile offenses. Most offenses are not considered to be the kind to deny someone admission to the bar. However, full disclosure is essential for someone seeking admission to any of the state bars, and a failure to disclose can result in non-admission. Also, candidates with any character and fitness issues must include the charge filed against him or her, the adjudication and a short description of events.
Optional Statements
Optional Kansas Statement
In a separate attachment, please briefly share with us any personal interest or connection to Kansas, the University of Kansas, or the University of Kansas School of Law.
Optional Diversity Statement
The University of Kansas School of Law seeks to build a diverse student body reflective of our community and our nation. In a separate attachment, please share with us your life experiences or personal characteristics that would add to the diversity of the student population and enrich the academic and cultural experience.
Optional Addendum
Please share with us any relevant information about your academic record or personal history that you did not address in your personal statement. This is your chance to provide context for anything that might cause you concern in your application.
Decisions &amp; Deadlines
KU Law makes its admissions decisions on a modified rolling basis with the goal of making decisions in as timely a manner as possible. Prior to the application priority deadline, we try to review applications and provide decisions in the order the applications are received.
Decision Timeline
The Admissions Committee begins reviewing applications in mid-November with the first decisions being released in mid-December. If your application is completed prior to December 15, you should receive a decision by January 31. After that period, we try to deliver decisions within 4 to 6 weeks of your application being completed. In sum, the earlier you complete your application, the sooner you will receive your answer.
Please note that the Admissions Committee selects some applications for an additional level of review. In these instances, please allow extra time for the Committee to make its decision.
Scholarship Decisions
At KU Law, we make our merit-based scholarship decisions at the same time we make our admissions decisions. You will be notified of any award at the time of your admissions decision.
