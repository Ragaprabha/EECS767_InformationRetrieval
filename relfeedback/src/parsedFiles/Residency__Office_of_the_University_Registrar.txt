                                Residency
        Resident tuition classification is determined by criteria found in Kansas statutes and regulations of the Kansas Board of Regents. Students are responsible for providing information sufficient to support their applications for resident classification. This is a general overview of the procedures and criteria used to determine resident status. It does not replace or supersede the statutes or Regents' regulations which contain the detailed requirements that must be met in order to prove resident status.
	You must have&nbsp;continuous physical residency in Kansas for at least 365 days prior to the first day of classes for which you are applying for residency.
	During those 365 days, your&nbsp;sources of financial support to meet your living expenses must come from Kansas sources. Living expenses include tuition and books if you are student. Sources of income that are from full-time, non-student jobs are more beneficial. Maintaining ties to other states will hinder your residency.
	You must&nbsp;show intent to remain in Kansas indefinitely. There are things that can strengthen your case but won't make you a resident by themselves. They are: Kansas driver's license, voter registration in Kansas, car registration in Kansas, owning a home in Kansas, etc.
	You must&nbsp;prove that you are residing in Kansas for reasons other than educational purposes.&nbsp;If you are a full-time student upon moving to Kansas, this requirement is the hardest to show because we will presume that you are here for educational purposes.
