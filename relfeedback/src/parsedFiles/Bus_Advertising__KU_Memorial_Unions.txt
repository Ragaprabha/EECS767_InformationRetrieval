*Student organizations receive free ads to promote their organization&#8217;s sponsored events. The free ads cannot be used to promote another campus unit&#8217;s events in an attempt to circumvent the pricing policies.
**Payment in the form of credit card, check or university departmental charge may be required before printing and lamination is completed.
	A request to post a bus ad must be made no later than 6 days before the posting date. Request to adsforbuses@ku.edu
	Ads must be submitted in a digital format to adsforbuses@ku.edu no later than 6 days before the posting date.
	Ad copy must be exactly 10&#8243; high by 16&#8243; wide.
	Ads should be submitted as a high resolution (300 dpi) PDF, JPEG or TIFF
	Lamination works best if the background is not a solid, dark color. Color images on white or light-colored backgrounds laminate the best.
	Ads must feature the name or logo of the sponsoring campus organization.
	Corporate sponsorship recognition cannot exceed a 2&#8243; x 3&#8243; space.
	All ads will be printed and laminated by the Union Bus Ad team. We cannot make exceptions due to the inconsistent nature of lamination. If the lamination is not the correct thickness, the ad won&#8217;t stay up. We have compared our pricing with other sources and have found that our fees are approximately 30 percent less than using off-campus sources.
	To reserve space and place ad orders you may send an email to adsforbuses@ku.edu. Advertising space is allocated on a first come/first served basis. It is rare that the buses run out of space.
	Your email order, with the ad attached (PDF), must include the name of the advertising organization, the billing address of the organization, contact name, email and phone number, and the desired dates to run the ad.
	Ads should be submitted by 8 a.m. on the Tuesday before the posting weekend.
